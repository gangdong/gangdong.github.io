  <div class = "about-page"> Hello! My name is David Dong and this is my website.<br><br>

  I live and work in Beijing, China :cn: . I am a software developer, currently working for a semi-conductor company abroad.<br><br>
  
  Here I write about what ever is on my mind, which tends to be related to designing and programming since that’s what I do and I enjoy helping people discover new skills and ideas.<br><br>
  
  Outside of work, my main interest is travel. I love to explore all kinds of landscapes and experience different customs around the world. I have some interesting stories about my travel and 📹 some beautiful photos, which have been collected into my <a href = "https://rainbow-ux.github.io/traveler-blog.github.io/">Album</a>.<br><br>

  If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to send an <a href = "mailto:dqdongg@hotmail.com"> Email</a> to me. You can also find me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/刚-董-25208ba0/">Linkin</a> or <a href = "https://github.com/gangdong">Github</a>, which I check often as well.<br>

  It is built by <a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and deployed on GitHub Pages, based on the <a href = "https://github.com/gangdong/jekyll-theme-rawposts">rawposts</a> theme.
