It has been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">196</code> days passed since the first case was reported at WUHAN city, China. During the past half year, millions of people were infected and more than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">400000</code> died around the whole world. ğŸ˜±</p>

<p>When will we end this pandemic? Do we have to co-exist with this virus in a long term? What is the world like after the epidemic?</p>

<p>Who knows? But I believe we will win the battle, the human beings will keep living on this planet, just like what they have done for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>God bless! I am lucky. In china :cn:, the situation is under control quickly after a short chaos at the beginning. People around me, my family and friends are all healthy, no one was infected.</p>

<p>I hope the epidemic will eventually pass and we will return to the normal life soon! âœŠ</p>
