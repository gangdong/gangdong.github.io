I"!<p>I’ve met an error <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validation Failed (422)</code> when using Gitalk in my blog.</p>

<p>I posted a new article in my blog and found the Gitalk report such issue. My Gitalk has been working for a long time before this issue occurs. I’ve checked that the Gitalk for my other posts works normally and only the new post has issue, which means the issue should be a standalone problem that related to the post self.</p>

<p>By searching google <a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk/issues/102">gitalk issue #102</a> I understood the problem is that the length of my new post’s URL is excessive long <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(&gt; 50 characters)</code>.</p>

<p>For every post, the Gitalk will create a Github issue under your blog project repository to track the comment thread. The issue’s id is used to form the issue’s label and Gitalk uses the label to identify comment thread.</p>

<p><img src="/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-gitalk-fix-01.PNG" alt="example" title="example" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>However the problem here is that label length is restricted to maximum 50 characters ( Not sure if it is a hidden rule or a BUG here 😕 ).</p>

<p>In my Gitalk configuration, the issue id is set to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">id: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">page</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">url</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.url</code> is too long and is beyond the restriction, the issue’s label cannot be created and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validation Failed</code> error will be threw out.</p>

<p>Since root cause is clear now, let’s fix it.    <br /></p>

<p>The straightforward way is to use a shorter URL to avoid this issue. But I don’t like this restriction that blocking I write post. To convert the URL to a fixed length string looks like a better solution. Why not try hash function? The interesting thing is that I found there has already been a same solution online <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/death05/article/details/83618887">-&gt; issue fix</a>, which use the <strong>MD5</strong> method. This method not only unifies the URL length but also differentiates them.</p>

<p>It is good!</p>

<p>There is workable <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5">JavaScript-MD5</a> lib on the Github, I folk it and the rest thing is quite simple.</p>

<p>I add the below code snippet for calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaScript-MD5</code> lib in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comments.html</code></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/daviddong.github.io/assets/js/md5.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and reset the Gitalk id to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">id: </span><span class="n">md5</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pathname</span><span class="p">),</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Commit the change.</p>

<p>I reopen the page and the error is gone, by checking the Gitalk issue’s label, it has been converted to MD5 code.</p>

<p><img src="/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-gitalk-fix-02.PNG" alt="example" title="example" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Which means the solution is working now! 😊</p>
